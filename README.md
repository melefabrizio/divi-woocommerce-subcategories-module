# WC Product Subcategories Module for Divi and

This is an extension plugin for Divi Builder by Elegant Themes and Woocommerce.

This plugin allows you to show dynamical product subcategories inside Divi Theme Builder Templates as a module:
tldr: you can place the [`[product_categories]` Woocommerce shortcode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/#section-13)
in any product archive page and make it refer to the current category.

### Features
* Add `[product_categories]` as a Divi module dynamically setting the
`ids` parameter to the current page's children categories
* **Options available**: number of columns, show or hide category count, show or hide
empty categories.
* **Styling**: yes, you can style almost every aspect of the text shown by the shortcode,
even the product count background color.

### Installing

As with any Wordpress plugin, download and install the latest zip from the [releases tab](https://github.com/melefabrizio/divi-woocommerce-subcategories-module/releases),
if you want you can clone this repo and adapt to your liking! It is based on [create-divi-extension](https://github.com/elegantthemes/create-divi-extension) so take
a look at that to get it running and building.
