This is an extension plugin for Divi Builder by Elegant Themes and Woocommerce.

This plugin allows you to show dynamical product subcategories inside Divi Theme Builder Templates as a module:
tldr: you can place the [`[product_categories]` Woocommerce shortcode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/#section-13)
in any product archive page and make it refer to the current category.

It is buggy and alpha stage, but if you don't push it too hard it works.

Download and install the latest zip from the [releases tab](https://github.com/melefabrizio/divi-woocommerce-subcategories-module/releases),
if you want you can clone this and adapt to your liking! It is based on [create-divi-extension](https://github.com/elegantthemes/create-divi-extension) so take
a look at that to get it running and building.
