A module for Divi Theme Builder to show the Woocommerce child categories of the current category page dynamically.

== Description ==
This is an extension plugin for Divi Builder by Elegant Themes and Woocommerce.

This plugin allows you to show dynamical product subcategories inside Divi Theme Builder Templates as a module. In simpler words,
you can place the [`[product_categories]` Woocommerce shortcode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/#section-13)
in any product archive page and make it refer to the category which the current page refers to.

Via the Divi frontend builder you can customize the look of the generated list of categories, as well tweak the shortcode parameters:
numbers of columns, show or hide category count, show or hide empty categories.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/divi-subcategories-module` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' screen in WordPress
3. Make sure Divi theme or Divi Builder are enabled
4. Insert the Woo Subcategories module on the Divi Theme Builder template assigned to one or more product category archive pages.
